==================================================================
This file is packaged with source, binaries, and/or assets for the
multiprotocol Slacker's QVM.  See the accompanying COPYING file for details.

When running this multiprotocol tremded, you'll need to copy both the vms-1.1.0 and
vms-gpp1 paks your `basepath/gamename`.

Add the following command line switch to serve both correctly

`+set fs_pk3PrefixPairs "&vms-1.1.0|vms-gpp1&"`
